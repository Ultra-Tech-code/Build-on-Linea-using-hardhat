## Objective

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to write a contract and deploy it with create2 on the CELO blockchain.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/): It is important to have a strong understanding of Solidity as it is the main programming language for creating smart contracts on the Celo blockchain.

- Command line proficiency: Basic familiarity with using command line tools such as the terminal or Command Prompt is necessary for running commands and scripts.

- Proficiency in [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): It is essential to have a good grasp of using Hardhat, a development environment designed for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the Celo blockchain.

## Requirements

- A text editor: For this tutorial, we will make use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system, with version V10. or higher.
- Node Package Manager [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) used for installing and managing dependencies.
-  Install [MetaMask Wallet](https://metamask.io/download/).

## A brief intro to Linea
Linea is a fully EVM equivalent zero-knowledge rollup (zk-rollup), designed to scale Ethereum with higher throughput and lowered transaction fees.
An EVM-equivalent network, scaling the Ethereum experience. Secured with a zero-knowledge rollup to Ethereum, built on quantum-resistant, lattice-based cryptography, powered by Consensys.

Linea relies on an innovative, internally-built, lattice-powered prover which utilizes zkSNARK technology. It enables proofs to be generated quickly and yet does not require a trusted setup, which has long been a flaw of zkSNARK technology.

### Benefits of Using Linea

1. **Low gas fees:**  Build dApps that users can interact with at scale.

2. **EVM equivalent:** Fully compatible with existing tooling, infrastructure, IDEs and wallets.

3. **Secured by Ethereum:** Backed by the security of Ethereum, where all rollup transactions are verified on-chain by a decentralized community of over 500k validators.

4. **Next gen scalability:** Innovative lattice-based zkSNARK prover generates fast zero-knowledge proofs.

5. **Developer-friendly design:** Built to minimize onboarding time, the rollup abstracts away ZK complexity, uses ETH for gas and has no reliance on third party transpilers or bespoke middleware

















# Usage
1. Install the [MetamaskWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) from the google chrome store.
2. Create a wallet.
3. Go to [https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea](https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea) 
and get tokens for the Linea Goerli.
4. Switch to the Linea Goerli in the MetamaskWallet.



This section should walk you through everything you need to get started:

Set up your wallet   
Linea comes with metamask directly so you don;t need to impoort or configure your metamask
Get funds from a faucet

here: [https://www.infura.io/faucet/linea]
here: [https://www.covalenthq.com/platform/faucet/]
here: [https://linea.faucetme.pro/]

you can also bridge your goerli eth to linea 
here[https://bridge.linea.build/]
Connect your wallet in the top-right corner of the page.

Verify that the bridge is set to Ethereum â†’ Linea Mainnet, and that manual claiming is enabled.

Enter the amount of ETH you want to bridge over to Linea Mainnet, and select the Start Bridging button.
nb: check that your network is on tetsnet if you are bridging your testnet token.

Bridge some funds
Deploy your first contract
If you run into a problem, step on over to the Linea Support page and let us know.


 >**_Note_**: check that your network is on tetsnet if you are bridging your testnet token.

setting up hardaht
